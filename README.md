# FakeNewsDetector---NLP
The project leverages Python for its implementation, combining NLP techniques (NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, HashingVectorizer) with machine learning (Multinomial Naive Bayes) to classify news articles as real or fake. Pandas is used for data handling, Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and feature extraction.
